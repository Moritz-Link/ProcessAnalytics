On this Django platform, log files can be read and viewed. Each case can be examined in its individual steps. Additionally, the platform allows for the modification of process step data. Lastly, a GNN (Graph Neural Network) has been trained to predict the "repair_In5days" variable. Although this function is currently implemented, the model is too large to be uploaded to GitHub.
