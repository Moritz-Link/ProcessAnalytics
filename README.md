# ProcessAnalytics
On this Django platform, log files can be read and viewed. Each case can be examined in its individual steps. In addition, the platform allows the modification of process step data. Finally, a GNN (Graph Neural Network) was trained to predict the variable "repair_In5days". Although this function is currently implemented, the model is too large to be uploaded to GitHub.

Data: The data is private.
